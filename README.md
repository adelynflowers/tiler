# Tiler

A project to try and facilitate creation of a board game that heavily leans on tile placement.

## Requirements
- Represent a game board of non-symmetrical tiles, including a distinct starting tile. Tiles are composed of multiple spaces in a designated shape. Spaces each have a terrain type chosen from a designated set of types.
- For a given set of tiles and terrain types, iterate over all possible combinations.
- For a given iteration, output a list of adjacencies found in the iteration.
- Adjacencies come in two flavors:
    - A single space of any type adjacent to multiple spaces with the same terrain type
    - A 2x2 block of the same terrain type
